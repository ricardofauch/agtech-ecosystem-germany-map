However, most of this data is difficult to find and usually only one aspect of the data is analysed. ...........
Analysing genome data means assigning a function to each individual letter in the genome. The difficulty is that genomes are up to 30 billion letters long but consist of only 4 different letters. And only about 1% of the letters in the genome contain important information like genes. Based on 20 years of genome research, we have developed a new, proprietary software, which we use in combination with a database of all the world's sequenced creatures to perform genome analyses with unprecedented quality and speed. Customers can have their own genomes analysed in service or use mendle, a Google-like search, to search our database for information that interests them.";"### BASIC FACTS

Producers of pharmaceuticals, food and beverages etc., need to monitor microbes in their processes. This includes quality control and fermentation. Existing technologies include manual microscopy and plating. They offer only limited automation, throughput, and data quality. As a result, the producers face inefficiencies and losses of 5-50% in their production. By getting better information with an automated solution, customers can optimize their production, detect contaminations, and thereby save resources, energy, machine time and labor.
